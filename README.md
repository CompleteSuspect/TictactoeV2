# TictactoeV2
An improved Tictactoe game written in Python.

This version of Tictactoe explores the creation of a scalable board. 
Although the board size is hardcoded to be 3x3, you can chose to have 5x5, or 21x21 if you're brave enough.

This version untilises dictionaries for human facing positional mapping, for example: A1 == 0,0.
This version also features more efficient win checking, and displays the scalable board nicely.

**How to run**
python tictactoe.py
